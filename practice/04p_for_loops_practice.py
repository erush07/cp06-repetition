# FOR LOOPS PRACTICE

# 1. PRACTICE:
# You are provided with two lists of first names:
# friends_of_X and friends_of_Y.

# Each list contains about 15 names, and there is some overlap
# between the lists.

# Write a Python program that loops through the list of Person X's friends.
# For each friend in Person X's list,
# the program should print the friend's name.

# If the friend is also in Person Y's list,
# print " - Mutual friend with Person Y!" after their name.

friends_of_X = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Emma", "Fiona", "George",
                "Hannah", "Isla", "Jack", "Katie", "Liam", "Mia", "Noah",
                "Olivia"]
friends_of_Y = ["Brad", "Charlie", "Daisy", "Emma", "Fiona", "George", "Henry",
                "Isla", "Jane", "Katie", "Liam", "Mike", "Nina", "Olivia",
                "Peter"]
