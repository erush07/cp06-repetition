# WHILE LOOPS PRACTICE
# ====================


# 1. PRACTICE: COMBINING DATA STRUCTURES WITH LOOPS
# Repeatedly ask the user:
# "Enter in a name of a friend. To stop enter STOP: "
# Store each name in a list
# Do this until they enter "STOP"

# After they enter "STOP", in a separate loop, ask the user:
# "Enter in the number of a friend in the list to see their name.
#  Enter 0 to exit: "

# E.g. if they enter 1, show them the first friend in the list,
# if they enter 3, show them the 3rd member of the list.
# do this until they enter 0 to exit.

# You can do this without using break, or with it, whatever you prefer

# CHALLENGE: Make it so that if they enter a number longer than
# the number of names in the list, it
# prints out "Invalid number, you only have X friends in the list" and doesn't
# throw an error. You might find the len() function good at this.
